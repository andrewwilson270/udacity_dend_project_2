# Data Modeling a PostgreSQL database with in Redshift
Udacity data engineering nano degree project

## Project Description
In this project, you'll act as a data engineer for a music streaming startup called Sparkify.

Sparkify has grown its user base and song database and wants to move its processes, data, and data analytics applications onto the cloud.

Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, and a directory with JSON metadata for the songs in their app. As their data engineer, you will be tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.



## Project Datasets

You'll be working with two datasets stored in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
To properly read log data s3://udacity-dend/log_data, you'll need the following metadata file:

Log metadata: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json
Keep in mind that the udacity-dend bucket is situated in the us-west-2 region. If you're copying the dataset to Redshift located in us-east-1, remember to specify the region using the REGION keyword in the COPY command.

You'll be working with two datasets stored in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
To properly read log data s3://udacity-dend/log_data, you'll need the following metadata file:

Log metadata: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json
Keep in mind that the udacity-dend bucket is situated in the us-west-2 region. If you're copying the dataset to Redshift located in us-east-1, remember to specify the region using the REGION keyword in the COPY command.

Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(opens in a new tab). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

'''song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json'''
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator(opens in a new tab) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

Log JSON Metadata
The log_json_path.json file is used when loading JSON data into Redshift. It specifies the structure of the JSON data so that Redshift can properly parse and load it into the staging tables.

In the context of this project, you will need the log_json_path.json file in the COPY command, which is responsible for loading the log data from S3 into the staging tables in Redshift. The log_json_path.json file tells Redshift how to interpret the JSON data and extract the relevant fields. This is essential for further processing and transforming the data into the desired analytics tables.

Below is what data is in log_json_path.json.

## Project Instructions

Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and event datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

Fact Table
1. songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
Dimension Tables
2. users - users in the app
   user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. songs - songs in music database
    song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. artists - artists in music database
    artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Template
To get started with the project, go to the workspace on the next page, where you'll find the project template. You can work on your project and submit your work through this workspace.

Alternatively, you can download the template files in the Resources tab in the classroom and work on this project on your local computer.

The project template includes four files:

- create_table.py is where you'll create your fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
- etl.py is where you'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
- sql_queries.py is where you'll define you SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.
- README.md is where you'll provide discussion on your process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

## Project Steps
Below are steps you can follow to complete each component of this project.

Create Table Schemas
1. Design schemas for your fact and dimension tables
2. Write a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in sql_queries.py
3. Complete the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and create these tables
4. Write SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist. This way, you can run create_tables.py whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.
5. Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
6. Add redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
7. Test by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database. You can use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.

Build ETL Pipeline
1. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
4. Delete your redshift cluster when finished.
